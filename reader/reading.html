        <p>In contrast to model-based approaches, SLAM systems operate in previously unknown environments in which they are able to estimate the camera pose and simultaneously create a map of the environment. For AR, SLAM systems are of interest as there is no requirement for predefined trackingtargets; however, their use creates additional complications making them dependent on the type of planned application. In particular, apart from accurate localization in an unknown environment, a detailed mapping of this environment in a denser format than a 3D point cloud or at least partial knowledge of planar surfaces is required for the registration of AR visualizations in the environment and for interactions with it.

            A motion model is used for the filter prediction step, and tracked feature positions are used for the correction step of the filter. An aspect of this approach and similar filter-based approaches was scalability. The increase in the map through the addition of new points leads to the increase in the filter state size and thus a rapid increase of computational complexity, an important development in visual SLAM.
